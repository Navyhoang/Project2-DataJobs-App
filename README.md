# Data Science Jobs Market

## Background

With the rapid advancement of technologies, data related jobs have become highly demanded in recent years. The computer technology boom in the past 20 years has made computer usage much easier and cheaper for everyone, and this has led to the enormous increase in data generation and the demand for data organization. With an easier access to data, and the importance of data in decision making, data analysis has become significantly crucial in all industries. According to the LinkedIn Workforce Report in the USA, the demand for data related professions has multiplied six times compared to five years ago, and this growth will continue for the next five years [1]. Therefore, people with data organization and analysis skills are highly in demand in the work force, and data related topics are currently the main innovation focus in many IT professionals.

## Object

This project focuses on the current job market for data related jobs in four different countries: The United States (US), Canada, Australia, and Singapore. Using the Extraction, Loading, Transformation (ETL) methodology, the project will extract all data related job postings from Indeed in these four countries, transform them, and load them into an SQL database. The project scope will include data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, and machine learning roles. Furthermore, this project also used the same ETL process to obtain the worldâ€™s university ranking data and mental health survey for further analysis on any possible relationships. 

With the job posting data stored on ElephantSQL, this web app uses JavaScript libraries, including D3.js, Plotly and Leaflet, to visualize data through heatmaps, bar charts, bubble charts and tables.

## Dashboard 

The dashboard is a representation of our data into an effective visualization. The dropdown menu can be used to see a comprehensive visualization dashboard based on a particular country.

* Heat Map - A world map with user interaction capabilities that shows all job demands for different cities in each country.

* Gauge Indicator - An user interactive indicator to show mental health survey responses based on each country.
