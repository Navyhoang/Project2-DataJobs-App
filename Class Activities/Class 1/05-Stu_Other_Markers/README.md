# Other Markers

In this activity we will create three vector shapes to use as markers.

## Instructions

* Using the files in the `Unsolved` folder as a starting point, create the following vector layers and add them to the map:

  * A red circle over the city of Dallas

  * A line connecting NYC to Toronto

  * A polygon that covers the area inside Atlanta, Savannah, Jacksonville and Montgomery

## Hints

* The [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) file contains some starter code.

* Use the 'Vector Layers' section of the [Leaflet documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html#toc) for reference.
