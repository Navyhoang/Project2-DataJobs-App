# World Cup Visualized

In this activity, we will add a circle for each country's all-time FIFA World Cup 3 point wins.

## Instructions

* Add your code to [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) to render the following:

  * A circle for each country in the data set.

  * A radius size determined by the country's all-time 3 point wins.

  * For countries with over 200 points, set the color of the circle to yellow.

  * For countries with over 100 points, set the color of the circle to blue.

  * For countries with over 90 points, set the color of the circle to green.

  * Render the remaining country circles in red.

* Make sure that each vector layer you include has a popup with the country's name and points.

## Hints

* The radius will need to be adjusted universally for better visuals.

* Refer to the [Leaflet docs for Path Options](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html#path-option) if stuck creating vector layers.
