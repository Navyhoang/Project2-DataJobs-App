# Rat Report Map

## Instructions

* You will be getting your hands dirty visualizing rodent sightings in New York City! Gross!

* Check out [the data for all 311 Service Requests in NYC (police non-emergency)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data).

  * You are going to have to build a query URL from the above so that only rodent complaints from 2016 are returned.
  * You should limit the data returned to 10,000 data points.

* Once you have successfully plotted your rat data, work towards incorporating the [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) plugin.

  * Cluster plugins can help to de-clutter a map with tons of data on it!

### Notes

* You can increase the data limit to 10,000 AFTER you get the cluster plugin working, but plotting 10,000 normal markers on a map may slow down your computer quite a bit.

### Bonuses

* If you finish plotting rodent-sighting data on the map, use the 311 Service Requests data to plot a similar graph with a different type of data.
